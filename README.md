## Start the app

Rename config file with `mv .env.dev-local .env` first

To start the development server run `nx serve app_name`.  Happy coding!

```shell
## Run service one by one
nx serve be # start backend server
nx serve bo # start frontend for back office
nx serve client # start frontend for client

## Run all services at the same time
nx run-many --targets serve
```

Open your browser navigate to
* http://localhost:4200/ for frontend for client 
* http://localhost:5173/ for back office

### DB migration

```bash
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up -d
npm run clean
npm run migrate
```

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).
